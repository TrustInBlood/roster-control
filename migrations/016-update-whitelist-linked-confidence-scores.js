 * Migration: Update confidence scores for existing whitelist-linked accounts

 * This migration finds PlayerDiscordLink records that were created for users
 * who have whitelist entries, and updates their confidence scores appropriately:
 * - Links created through whitelist operations should have 0.5 confidence
 * - Links that were manually verified should remain at 1.0 confidence
 * - Admin-created links should have 0.7 confidence
